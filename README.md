# **Zalo Mini App – Data Visualization and Filtering**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a **Zalo Mini Application** designed to **visualize data through interactive charts and filters**. It provides users with a seamless experience to explore, analyze, and interact with various data categories. The app integrates with **Supabase** for backend data storage, supports **real-time updates**, and leverages **Zalo's developer environment** for smooth integration within the Zalo ecosystem.

----------

## **Key Features**

✅ **Dynamic Data Visualization:** Displays data insights using **Ant Design Charts (Antd Charts)** with various chart types (line, bar, pie, etc.).  
✅ **Advanced Filtering Options:** Users can filter data based on different **categories and parameters** to get tailored insights.  
✅ **Real-time Data Management:** Powered by **Supabase**, ensuring real-time updates when data changes.  
✅ **Optimized UI/UX:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, mobile-first, and lightweight interface.  
✅ **State Management with Zustand:** Efficient and lightweight state handling for better performance.  
✅ **Zalo Developer Integration:** Fully compatible with Zalo’s environment to provide a **native-like experience** inside the Zalo Mini App.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend:**

-   **React (TypeScript)** – Provides a modular and scalable structure.
-   **Tailwind CSS** – For fast, responsive, and modern UI styling.
-   **Ant Design Charts (Antd Charts)** – For professional and high-performance data visualization.
-   **ZMP CLI** – (Zalo Mini Program CLI) to build and manage the Zalo Mini App environment.

### **Backend & State Management:**

-   **Supabase** – A **PostgreSQL-based** backend with real-time data syncing.
-   **Zustand** – Lightweight global state management for better performance and flexibility.

### **Deployment & Integration:**

-   **Zalo Developer Environment** – Provides a smooth experience within the Zalo ecosystem.
-   **Zalo APIs** – Allows the app to interact with user data and services on Zalo.

## **How It Works**

1️⃣ **User Opens the Mini App in Zalo** → The app loads and fetches data from **Supabase**.  
2️⃣ **Data Visualization** → The app renders different **charts** using Ant Design Charts.  
3️⃣ **Filtering System** → Users can filter and refine data views dynamically.  
4️⃣ **State Management** → Zustand efficiently updates and syncs UI state without unnecessary re-renders.  
5️⃣ **Real-Time Updates** → Changes in Supabase are reflected instantly in the app.
